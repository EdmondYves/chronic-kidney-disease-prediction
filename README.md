# chronic-kidney-disease-prediction
The goal of this project is to look at the factors that could be indicative of kidney failure and predict the likelihood of someone suffering from the disease. I approach the problem from two angles. I first looked at “Factors to be taken seriously at home” and then explored “Factors from a physician perspective”. I used a copy of the "kidney_disease" dataset from the data repository of the University of California Irvine (UCI).
